## Selected topic
US Road Accidents and their impact on Traffic (Delays)

## Reason topic selected / Inspiration
US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time accident prediction, studying accident hotspot locations, casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. 

This Accident dataset is additionally attractive to us because, we are able to apply deep learning models to the data set due to its large number of features. 

## Description of data source
This data is located on Kaggle and is a countrywide traffic accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the United States. This data has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains data that is collected from February 2016 to December 2019 for the Contiguous United States.

These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. 

While not all inputs are complete for each line item, there are nearly 50 features presented. Some of these are unsuitable for our project while others lack enough information to be worth including. Prior to cleaning and transforming data, there are approximately 3M entries.

## Questions hope to answer with data
There are 2 parts to this project:

(i) Predict US Road Accident Severity using a Machine Learning model, where severity is defined as impact on traffic (delays)

(ii) Create a US heatmap visualization based on the severity of the accidents

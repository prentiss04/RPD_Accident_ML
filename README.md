# RPD_Accident_ML

## Selected topic
Using publicly available US Road Accident data from 2016-2019, we will use machine learning to create a model to predict the traffic severity as it pertains to an accident. 

## Reason topic selected 
Initially we wanted to create a model that would predict crime type based on certain parameters. The issue was that there were too few inputs to expect that we would be able to achieve suitable accuracy. The Accident dataset was attractive because we can still apply machine learning models to the data set with considerably more inputs and a robust dataset to make development viable.  

## Description of data source
The data was located on Kaggle and is a US countrywide dataset covering 49 states from February 2016 to December 2019. While not all inputs are complete for each entry, there are nearly 50 inputs presented. Some of these are unsuitable for our project while others lack enough information to be worth including. Prior to dropping data, there are approximately 3M entries.  

## Questions hope to answer with data
The goal of this project is through machine learning take the characteristics of historical traffic accidents to predict traffic impact (i.e. severity).
